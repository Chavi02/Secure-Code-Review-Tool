## Secure-Code-Review-Tool
This tool is a software solution designed to evaluate whether code adheres to predefined standards. Users can input code through a user-friendly interface, and the software's backend processes the code using OpenAI's GPT-4 model. The model analyzes the code against a set of predefined rules and guidelines, determining if the code is compliant or non-compliant.
